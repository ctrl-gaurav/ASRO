> An intelligent AI system that automatically optimizes HPC cluster resources, reducing waste and manual intervention

## 🎯 The Problem

Large HPC clusters face critical resource management challenges:

- **GPU Underutilization**: Jobs request more resources than they use, leaving expensive hardware idle
- **Configuration Errors**: Incorrect GPU bindings cause jobs to fail or run inefficiently
- **Manual Overhead**: Administrators spend hours diagnosing issues and tuning parameters
- **Queue Congestion**: Resource waste leads to longer wait times for all users

These problems cost research facilities thousands of dollars daily and slow down scientific progress.

## 💡 Our Solution

ASRO is an intelligent multi-agent system that continuously monitors your HPC cluster, identifies inefficiencies, and safely applies optimizations with minimal human intervention. It combines real-time monitoring, AI-powered planning, and multi-stage safety mechanisms to keep your cluster running at peak efficiency.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 Intelligent Multi-Agent Architecture
Five specialized AI agents work collaboratively to optimize your cluster:
- **Monitor Agent** - Continuous resource tracking and anomaly detection
- **Profiler Agent** - Historical usage analysis and pattern recognition
- **Planner Agent** - AI-powered optimization recommendations
- **Executor Agent** - Safe action implementation with rollback
- **Audit Agent** - Complete transparency and approval workflows

### 🛡️ Safety-First Design
Multiple layers of protection ensure no disruption to running workloads:
- Simulation before execution
- Risk-based human approval gates
- Canary deployments for high-risk changes
- Automatic rollback on performance degradation
- Comprehensive audit trails

### 📊 Real-Time Insights
Web dashboard provides instant visibility into:
- Current cluster utilization and bottlenecks
- Pending optimization recommendations
- Historical performance trends
- Cost savings and efficiency gains

### 🔧 Enterprise-Grade Architecture
Built on proven technologies for production reliability:
- Kubernetes orchestration for scalability
- Kafka event streaming for durability
- gRPC with mTLS for secure communication
- PostgreSQL and Redis for data persistence

## 🏗️ System Design

ASRO implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## 🚀 Project Motivation

This design emerged from real operational challenges we encountered:

> During job submission to Virginia Tech's ARC cluster, we received an alert about low GPU utilization. Investigation revealed our code was accessing the wrong GPU due to incorrect device mapping - a problem that required manual diagnosis and intervention. Similar resource allocation issues are common across HPC facilities worldwide.

ASRO addresses these challenges through intelligent automation while maintaining the safety guarantees required for production infrastructure.
